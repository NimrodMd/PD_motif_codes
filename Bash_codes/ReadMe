These bash scripts are designed to run on a cluster. In each step there is an "outer" (paralel) script that runs and "internal" (in) script on all the files simultaneusly.
Normally, the running time is around three hours on a regular computer

The output is files of aligned tRFs and miRs and csv files of counts and CPMs of both of these RNA types.
Note that these scripts are designed for Homo sapiens. miRs can be adjusted to other spiscies but MINTmap currently doesnt have this option.

The dependencies are detailed in the folder "ClusterStuff" with links to installation. Upon installation, the programs should be saved in one folder
(in my case i saved all the programs in the folder "ClusterStuff" and the paths in the scripts folow this reasoning)
Installation time is roughly a couple of hours on regular computers
