**These codes and files accomapny the paper *Pre-symptomatic Parkinsonâ€™s disease blood test quantifying repetitive sequence motifs in transfer RNA fragments*, by Madrer et al.**

This folder contains two subfolders:
1. Bash_codes:
   - Codes that were used to align the FASTQ files to tRFs
   - Clusterstuff - conatin adaptor sequences used for diffret datasets and the dependencies (lnks to installation) for the allignment process
   - FASTQ - an toy set of two samples
3. R_codes:
   - The various R codes used to analyse the data
   - A folder (name matching to the code file) containg the data used for the code (*in cases in which data is confidential, a simulated data is supplaied*)
